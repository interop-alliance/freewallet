# History

## 0.10.0 - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- Stop silently swallowing remote-storage failures in `WASRemoteStore`. The
  catch blocks in `addCollectionResource`, `listCollectionItems`,
  `deleteCredential`, and `wipeStorage` now rethrow after logging instead of
  masking the error (or, in `listCollectionItems`, crashing on an `undefined`
  response). `fetchDocument` still treats a `404` as "not found" (returns
  `undefined`) but rethrows network/auth/server errors so they are no longer
  mistaken for a missing document. Removed the unconditional
  `"Remote space deleted."` success log on wipe failure.
- Surface those failures in the UI: `AcceptCredentialsPage`, `SettingsPage`,
  `CredentialDetailPage`, `IssuerDetailPage`, `SignupPage`, and `GuestLoginPage`
  now show an error message instead of leaving the user hanging. In particular,
  `SettingsPage` no longer logs the user out as if the wipe succeeded when the
  remote deletion failed.

### Changed

- Replace `@digitalcredentials/verifier-core` with the TypeScript fork
  `@interop/verifier-core`. The fork un-bundled the convenience checks into a
  composable suite pipeline, so the removed expiration check and the rich
  issuer-registry lookup are re-added as custom suites
  (`src/lib/verifierSuites/`); `verify.ts` now adapts the fork's
  `CredentialVerificationResult` back into the wallet's internal verification
  payload so the view layer is unchanged. Rich issuer metadata is sourced from
  `@digitalcredentials/issuer-registry-client`.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Add a separate WAS-integration e2e project (`pnpm run test:e2e:was`) that boots
  a local `was-teaching-server` and exercises the remote (WAS) storage path.

### Changed

- Replace `@digitalcredentials/ssi` with `@interop/data-integrity-core` and
  `@digitalcredentials/ed25519-signature-2020` with `@interop/ed25519-signature`.
- Replace `@digitalcredentials/ezcap`, `@digitalcredentials/http-client`, and
  `@digitalcredentials/security-document-loader` with their TypeScript
  `@interop/` forks.
- Run the local-mode e2e suite on a dedicated port with a fresh server and
  local (IndexedDB) storage pinned, so a separately-running dev server can no
  longer be reused and cause failures.

### Fixed

- Fix the logout page firing redundant, deferred redirects (from a React
  StrictMode double-invoke and an effect re-run when the session cleared), where
  a late redirect could navigate away from a page the user had already moved to.
  Logout now runs once and redirects once.
- Fix a flaky login e2e test where the freshly-navigated login form could
  remount and clear the typed passphrase before submit.
